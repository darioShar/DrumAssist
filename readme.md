This Drum'Assist project aims at reproducing a perfect hitting pattern on a snare. The mechanical system is articulated by an arduino wired to the computer. This program updates the hitting patern in the following way : it listens the hit through a connected microhpone, analyzes the audio signal (fft, and correlation with pre-recorded relevant type of hits), and updates hitting pattern by transmitting computation results to arduino.

GUI program using Qt.
